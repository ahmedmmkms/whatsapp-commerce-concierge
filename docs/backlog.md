## Bootstrap to GitHub
Requires: Personal Access Token with repo scope in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Dry run (offline, no API calls):
`pwsh scripts/bootstrap-github-work-items.ps1 -DryRun -Offline -OnlySprint 5 -Owner you -Repo yourrepo`

Create milestones/issues (start date optional):
`pwsh scripts/bootstrap-github-work-items.ps1 -StartDate 2025-09-15`

The script infers `owner/repo` from `git remote origin`. Override with:
`pwsh scripts/bootstrap-github-work-items.ps1 -Owner yourname -Repo yourrepo`

Labels
- The bootstrap script auto-creates common labels (backend, frontend, infra, qa, docs, whatsapp, catalog, cart, checkout, payments, orders, returns, cms, observability, performance, security, i18n) and applies them to issues based on keywords in the title/body.

Windows PowerShell (no pwsh)
- Set token: `$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = '<YOUR_PAT_WITH_repo_scope>'`
- One-shot run: `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\bootstrap-github-work-items.ps1 -DryRun -Offline -OnlySprint 5 -Owner you -Repo yourrepo`
- Or run in session: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass; .\scripts\bootstrap-github-work-items.ps1 -DryRun -Offline -OnlySprint 5 -Owner you -Repo yourrepo`
